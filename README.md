# Rails Retro

## Introduction

Welcome to the Rails Retro, a week long project completed by GitHub user [Logan Meets World](https://github.com/loganmeetsworld) as part of the [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/) Fourth Cohort in November 2015. 

## Installation

* This is a Rails Project. Simply clone the repo and `bundle install` from the terminal and you should be set up to run this on your local computer.
* Git: `git clone git@github.com:loganmeetsworld/RetroRails.git`

## Concept 

This project is based off of an agile practice that my cohort does every week: [Retrospective](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Agile_Retrospective_Resource_Wiki). I wanted to make a web application version of our Retro board so that people can add, edit, and delete additions from their compute anonymously rather than getting up in public and writing something on our physical board. Most important, now you can use emojis in your retros.

## Technologies

* Ruby on Rails 2.2.3
* Rspec for Rails for TDD
* HTML5/CSS3
* Bootstrap for CSS

## Features

* Ability to see your team's retrospective board 
* Ability to edit, delete, and add items to the four retrospective categories - 1. Areas for improvement, 2. Less of, 3. More of, 4. Positive recognition
* Ability to organize the retroboards by week by 'retiring' a board to the archive
* Responsive Design

## Improvements for the Future

* Authentification for custom login for my users
* Mobile first development for easy of use on your device
* Javascript for a more fluid front-end

## Contributing to development

Code reviews would be fantastic for this project. I am a 2 month old developer at the launch of this project and really love all the feedback I can get. I also will trying to maintain and update the project for future use and add better front-end components as I learn them. If you see an area for improvement on this project, a PR is more than welcome as well. 

## Browser support
* Fully supports Chrome so far.
